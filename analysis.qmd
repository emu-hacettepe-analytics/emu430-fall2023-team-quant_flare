First of all, we generated the data that would be useful to us from TURKSTAT's website. After downloading the data as an Excel file, we changed the positions of the columns and raws, making it easier to work on it. Next, we anchored the rows and columns of the data so that R could read them. Finally, we created column headings for the cities.


```{# {r graph making process}
# We converted the data to long format for ggplot2
library(tidyr)
foreign_child_long <- gather(foreign_child_by_year_xlsx, key = "Year", value = "Value", -City)

# Code for Printing the structure and head of the data frame for inspection
str(foreign_child_long)
head(foreign_child_long)

# Converting the 'Year' column to a factor for correct ordering
foreign_child_long$Year <- factor(foreign_child_long$Year, levels = c("2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022"))

# Checking the levels of the 'Year' factor
levels(foreign_child_long$Year)

# Creating a line plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(foreign_child_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = City, color = City)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Foreign Child Population Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Population") +
  theme_minimal()



```
