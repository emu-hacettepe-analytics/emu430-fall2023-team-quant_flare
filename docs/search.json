These sources include information that is current and dependable, having been collected by using techniques like massive field surveys and censuses. This will ensure the accuracy and reliability of the basics that our study is based on.\nWe chose this data set in order to figure out the causes behind the changes in Turkey’s demographic structure. Indicators such as the population growth rate and the number of foreign births have importance to assessing a nation’s demographic progress and forecasting future trends. We will be able to better understand the population’s age distribution, migratory patterns, and relationships with socioeconomic characteristics through analyses performed on this data collection.\nThis study’s primary objectives are to identify any potential social effects of Turkey’s changing demographic structure and to get a thorough understanding of these changes. Additionally, these evaluations are meant to give insight on strategic planning by projecting future demographic patterns.[1]\n\n\nData Set\nWe received the data we will discuss in this project from TÜİK. You can access the resources from here and here.\n[1]We got help from QuillBot’s Paraphraser and Grammar Checker tools to use more effective phrases in the texts we prepared.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
