These sources conduct extensive field surveys and censuses to provide reliable and up-to-date information. In this way, we ensure the reliability and accuracy of the basic data on which our study is based.\nWe chose this data set because we aim to better understand the changes in Turkey’s population structure and the reasons for these changes. Population growth rate and foreign baby numbers are important indicators for assessing a country’s demographic development and predicting future demographic trends. Analyzes to be made on this data set will help us understand the age distribution of the population, migration movements and relationships with socioeconomic factors.\nThe main goal of this study is to understand the changes in Turkey’s population structure in depth, to determine the potential impacts of these changes on society and to predict future demographic trends.[1]\n\n\nData Set\nWe received the data we will discuss in this project from TÜİK. You can access the resources from here and here.\n\n\nTeaser\nYou can reach from link\n[1]We got help from QuillBot’s Paraphraser and Grammar Checker tools to use more effective phrases in the texts we prepared.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

After downloading the data as an Excel file, we changed the positions of the columns and raws, making it easier to work on it. Next, we anchored the rows and columns of the data so that R could read them. Finally, we created column headings for the cities.\n\nLoading necessary libraries :\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nLoad the data:\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(readxl)\nurl &lt;- \"https://github.com/emu-hacettepe-analytics/emu430-fall2023-team-quant_flare/raw/master/Foreign_child_by_year.xlsx\"\ntemp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".xlsx\")\ndownload.file(url, temp_file, mode = \"wb\")\ndataset &lt;- read_excel(temp_file)\n\nhead(dataset)\n\n\nA tibble: 6 × 10\nCity 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022           1 Adana 2416 2148 1810 2031 3211 3899 3951 4151 4195 2 Adıyaman 57 69 142 303 520 554 474 505 564 3 Afyonkarahisar 1027 1342 2005 2063 3036 3625 3741 4025 3736 4 Ağrı 198 136 163 118 149 146 111 188 219 5 Aksaray 1482 1865 2780 3291 4605 4839 5088 5664 5740 6 Amasya 347 704 1022 1005 1659 1660 1575 1462 1313\n\nShow the code\nstr(dataset)\n\ntibble [81 × 10] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) $ City: chr [1:81] “Adana” “Adıyaman” “Afyonkarahisar” “Ağrı” … $ 2014: num [1:81] 2416 57 1027 198 1482 … $ 2015: num [1:81] 2148 69 1342 136 1865 … $ 2016: num [1:81] 1810 142 2005 163 2780 … $ 2017: num [1:81] 2031 303 2063 118 3291 … $ 2018: num [1:81] 3211 520 3036 149 4605 … $ 2019: num [1:81] 3899 554 3625 146 4839 … $ 2020: num [1:81] 3951 474 3741 111 5088 … $ 2021: num [1:81] 4151 505 4025 188 5664 … $ 2022: num [1:81] 4195 564 3736 219 5740 …\n\nShow the code\nsummary(dataset)\n\n City                2014            2015            2016      \nLength:81 Min. : 5 Min. : 4 Min. : 4\nClass :character 1st Qu.: 192 1st Qu.: 213 1st Qu.: 240\nMode :character Median : 447 Median : 603 Median : 941\nMean : 1048 Mean : 1419 Mean : 1914\n3rd Qu.: 939 3rd Qu.: 1364 3rd Qu.: 1663\nMax. :19700 Max. :26700 Max. :33938\n2017 2018 2019 2020\nMin. : 5 Min. : 5 Min. : 6 Min. : 8\n1st Qu.: 178 1st Qu.: 264 1st Qu.: 381 1st Qu.: 376\nMedian : 1088 Median : 1303 Median : 1354 Median : 1224\nMean : 2309 Mean : 3425 Mean : 4082 Mean : 3570\n3rd Qu.: 2076 3rd Qu.: 2932 3rd Qu.: 3401 3rd Qu.: 2991\nMax. :46736 Max. :71830 Max. :92286 Max. :66703\n2021 2022\nMin. : 11 Min. : 11\n1st Qu.: 505 1st Qu.: 449\nMedian : 1272 Median : 1313\nMean : 4506 Mean : 4561\n3rd Qu.: 3276 3rd Qu.: 3029\nMax. :113605 Max. :118735\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

We obtained this information from the Turkish Statistical Institute’s (TUIK) database.\n\n\nWhy did we choose this data?\nWe intended to carry out a study to look at the severity of the immigration issue in our nation over time, which began in Turkey approximately ten years ago. We looked at the distribution of the growing number of foreign children in Turkey by years and provinces. Since immigrants have been arriving from various nations (Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc.) and raising children there, we also looked at how these provinces’ demographic structures will likely deteriorate over the next few years. Our goal is to examine this data set and forecast the balance that will develop between Turkish and international students in the upcoming years, as well as the implications and effects on the educational environment in schools.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
